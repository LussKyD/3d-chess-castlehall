Place HDRI (.hdr) or GLTF assets here.

Recommended structure:
- assets/models/king.gltf (also used for royal king)
- assets/models/queen.gltf (also used for royal queen)
- assets/models/guard.gltf
- assets/models/pawn.gltf
- assets/models/rook.gltf
- assets/models/knight.gltf
- assets/models/bishop.gltf
- assets/models/dungeon_room.gltf

Optional HDRI example name:
- assets/castle_hall_HDRI.hdr

You can replace these with your production assets. If a model is missing, the app
falls back to the current placeholder geometry.
